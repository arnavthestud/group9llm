# Present Perfect Continuous Tense

## Core Uses

### 1. Action that began in the past and continues into the present
- Refers to actions that started at some point in the past and are still happening or have just finished with relevance to the present.
- Examples:
  - She has been reading for two hours.
  - They have been working on this project since morning.

### 2. Action that has recently stopped and has a visible result
- Used to describe an action that has just finished, where the effects are still noticeable or important in the present.
- Examples:
  - I am tired because I have been running.
  - The ground is wet because it has been raining.

### 3. Emphasizing the duration of an activity
- Highlights the amount of time an action has been occurring, often using time expressions like "for" or "since."
- Examples:
  - He has been studying for five hours.
  - We have been living here since 2010.

## Special Considerations

### 1. Use with time expressions
- The Present Perfect Continuous is often used with time expressions to emphasize the duration of the activity.
  - for
  - since
  - all day
  - all week

### 2. Difference between Present Perfect and Present Perfect Continuous
- The Present Perfect Continuous emphasizes the duration or ongoing nature of an action, while the Present Perfect focuses on the completion or result of an action.
- Examples:
  - I have worked here for two years. (Present Perfect, focusing on the result)
  - I have been working here for two years. (Present Perfect Continuous, focusing on the duration)

### 3. Non-continuous verbs
- Certain verbs, such as stative verbs, are not commonly used in the Present Perfect Continuous tense.
- Examples:
  - I have known her for years. (Correct: Present Perfect with stative verb)
  - I have been knowing her for years. (Incorrect: Present Perfect Continuous with stative verb)
